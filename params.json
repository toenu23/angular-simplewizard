  "body": "## angular-simplewizard\r\nA simple wizard directive for angular.js\r\n\r\nIt's easy to use and fully customize-able and allows you to setup complex multi-step forms with diverging/converging branches.\r\n\r\nThe HTML for each step must be in an own file which is ng-included by the directive. Each step is a regular angular form, but you may do validation with data from all steps.\r\n\r\n### Usage ###\r\nInclude the library in your HTML file\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"angular-simplewizard.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nAdd `simpleWizard` to your app's dependencies:\r\n\r\n    var app = angular.module('App', ['simpleWizard']);\r\n\r\nUse the `wizard` directive:\r\n\r\n    <wizard model=\"orderForm\" step=\"product\" template=\"wizardTmpl\"></wizard>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `<wizard>` directive has the following attributes:\r\n\r\n - `model`\r\nThe variable to be populated with the results of the wizard\r\n\r\n - `step` (optional)\r\nThe initial step from which the wizard begins. If not specified, the first element in the `template` object is the initial step.\r\n\r\n - `template`\r\n Template object containing the steps of the wizard and their logic.\r\n A step is identified by its object key and has the following parameters:\r\n\r\n\r\n  - `view` [string] URL to the template (required)\r\n  - `prev` and `next` [string or function] The name of the previous and next step, or a function returning it.\r\n  - `validate` [function] Custom validation function\r\n\r\nA template may look something like this: (See example for more details)\r\n\r\n\r\n    $scope.wizardTmpl = {\r\n    \r\n      product: {\r\n      ...\r\n      },\r\n    \r\n      account: {\r\n        view: 'views/account.html',\r\n        prev: 'product',\r\n        next: function(model) {\r\n          return (model.type === 'ebook') ? 'payment' : 'shipping';\r\n        },\r\n        validate: function(model) {\r\n          // 'model' contains data from all steps\r\n          // Do some validation\r\n          return true;\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    \r\n      shipping: {\r\n        ...\r\n      },\r\n\r\n      payment: {\r\n        ...\r\n      },\r\n\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following functions are exposed to the scope and available in your view files:\r\n\r\n\r\n- `wizardSubmit()` Submit the current step. The wizard will perform validation and navigate to the next step if successful. Ideally, this function is given as the `ng-submit` parameter of the form.\r\n\r\n- `wizardBack([toReset])` Navigate to the previous step. The optional parameter `toReset` (Array) contains the names of keys of the model to reset to their inital state. This may be necessary if the user navigates back multiple steps.\r\n\r\n- `wizardNext()` Go to the next step without validation\r\n\r\n- `wizardGoTo(step)` Go to any step defined in the template\r\n\r\n- `wizardReset()` Completely reset the wizard and return to the inital step\r\n\r\n### Demo ###\r\nTo do\r\n",
